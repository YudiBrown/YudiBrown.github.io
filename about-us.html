After her marriage she relocated to the Ukraine with her husband Rabbi Shmuli. She became the deputy head of a girls college, promoting Judaism, Ivrit and the love of the land of Israel to all students. Due to the lack of Kosher products, her hobby cooking at which she excelled became very useful. People from all over came to the Brown’s as Shabbat &amp; weekday guests for the warmth, conversations and of course the delicious food.</p>

The intellect’s role in the spiritual life of a Jew is an integral focus of Chabad’s philosophy. At Liverpool Universities, Chabad strives to provide a level of religious education comparable to the universities traditions of quality learning. Students can take advantage of the chance to learn more about Judaism, its holidays and day-to-day observances. There are also ample opportunities for in-depth study of Jewish sources, including classical texts, like the Torah and Halacha, and Jewish mystical traditions like the Kabbalah and Chassidus. Study may be in groups or in individual sessions with the Rabbi. The values that lie at the heart of Chabad of Liverpool Univerpool are embodied in Torah and Jewish tradition. These values are:</p>
<ul class="content_list" style="color: #000000;">
<li>The welcoming of every Jew</li>
<li>Creating a sense of belonging</li>
<li>Jewish learning</li>
<li>Spiritual growth and practice</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Philosophy:</strong> The Chabad House at Liverpool Universities is based on the ideology of Chabad, which has at its foundation the encompassing mitzvah “to love every Jew as one loves himself” and to permeate that love with Acts of Kindness and Mitzvahs. It’s our belief that every individual Jew has an indispensable contribution to make to the totality of the Jewish people. Chabad seeks to engage fellow Jews at their own pace and comfort level through innovative educational programs in all areas of Jewish life.</p>
<p><strong>Inspired</strong> By The Lubavitcher Rebbe, Rabbi Menachem M. Schneerson, of blessed memory. For a glimpse into the Rebbe’s legacy,&nbsp;<a title="" href="http://www.therebbe.org/" target="_blank">click here</a></p>
<p><strong>Future</strong> We believe that Jewish education and meaningful experiences are the grass-roots method to fighting indifference, apathy and assimilation that face our community today. For there to be a Jewish tomorrow, our students need to have a Jewish today!</p>

<p>Going away to university is a priceless opportunity to mature and thrive intellectually, socially and politically. For Jewish students it is also an opportunity to deepen and broaden one’s Jewish identity, and enhance the sense of committment and responsibility to the greater Jewish community – on campus, at home, nationwide and throughout the world.</p>
<p>Here, at Chabad of Liverpool Universities, we pride ourselves on creating a “home away from home” for all the Jewish students at the universities. Our home is open to the students, and we welcome them with the warmth of family. We strive to create meaningful relationships with a broad spectrum of students. Through our diverse and dynamic programming, we offer everything from weekly Shabbat dinners, exciting trips,&nbsp;fun social events, and engaging Jewish educational opportunities.</p>
<p>We understand that as a parent, there can be many worrisome moments while your child is away at university. That’s why we want you to know that we’re here. Feel free to contact us, introduce yourselves and let us know what’s on your mind. Students, if you have any query, question or just want a friendly chat please get in touch with us. We’ll be glad to assist in any way possible.</p>
<p>Sincerely,</p>
<p>Rabbi Shmuli &amp; Tzivia Brown</p>
